Yong Ju Lee et al., submitted to *Royal Society Open Science*.

## Contents
- NIR spectral dataset (1250–1700 nm)
- Code for preprocessing, PCA, k-NN, SVM, and ANN classification
- SHAP interpretation scripts

## Data Description
- 260 spectra from 26 traditional handmade papers (Hanji, Washi, Xuan)
- Acquired using Resonon Pika NIR-320 (900–1700 nm)
- Preprocessed via Savitzky–Golay 2nd derivative and L2 normalization
